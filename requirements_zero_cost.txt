# Installation Notes:
# 1. Install core dependencies first: pip install -r requirements.txt
# 2. Install zero-cost dependencies: pip install -r requirements_zero_cost.txt
# 3. For TOR support: brew install tor (macOS) or apt-get install tor (Linux)
# 4. For Tesseract OCR: brew install tesseract (macOS) or apt-get install tesseract-ocr (Linux)
# 5. Chrome/Chromium will be downloaded automatically by pyppeteer

# Docker Integration:
# All dependencies are designed to work in Docker containers
# Chrome/Chromium will be bundled in the Docker image for zero-setup deployment
