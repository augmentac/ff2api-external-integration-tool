# Removed problematic dependencies that cause Streamlit Cloud installer errors:
# - aiohttp-proxy (not available on Streamlit Cloud)
# - aiohttp-socks (causes conflicts)
# - tls-client (too complex for cloud deployment)
# - httpx-socks (conflicts with other libraries)
# - ujson (conflicts with orjson)
# - orjson (can cause memory issues)
# - colorlog (not needed for production)
# - structlog (too complex)
# - python-user-agents (conflicts with fake-useragent)
# - asyncio-throttle (not needed)
# - aiofiles (not needed)
# - tzlocal (not needed)

# Phase 2 Features (using cloud-compatible alternatives):
# - Advanced browser fingerprinting with fake-useragent and user-agents
# - Basic proxy support with pysocks (fallback mode)
# - Enhanced session management with aiohttp
# - Human behavior simulation with built-in timing
# - Error handling with backoff and retrying
# - Request rotation with httpx as fallback
