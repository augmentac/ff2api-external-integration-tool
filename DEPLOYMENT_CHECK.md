## How to Verify Deployment

1. Check the `method` field in tracking results:
   - If showing "Streamlit Cloud Tracker" → old version deployed
   - If showing "cloud_native_tracker_*_v2.0.1" → new version deployed

2. Check for additional fields in error results:
   - `explanation`: Detailed error explanation
   - `next_steps`: User guidance
   - `methods_attempted`: List of attempted methods
   - `debug_info`: Debugging information

## Deployment Status

- **Local testing**: ✅ Working - R&L Carriers returns success
- **Cloud deployment**: ❌ Not working - still showing old format

## Next Steps

If the cloud deployment is still showing the old format:
1. Check Streamlit Cloud deployment logs
2. Verify all files are being uploaded correctly
3. Clear any deployment cache
4. Consider redeploying the application
